# Imputation Methods

The following imputation methods are tested on both the MCAR and MAR datasets. A regression model is fit on the imputed dataset, and the results are summarized.

## 1. Listâ€‘wise (Case) Deletion

List-wise deletion removes any case with missing values from analysis and is the default method in many statistical software tools. It works well when data is large and missing completely at random (MCAR). However, if these conditions are not met, it can lead to bias and loss of important information, making it a less suitable approach.

```{r}
listwise_deletion_data <- listwise_deletion(data.MAR.uni)
```
## 2. Pairwise Deletion

Pairwise deletion minimizes information loss compared to list-wise deletion by only removing data points when necessary to check if missing values are truly missing. It produces lower bias for data missing completely at random (MCAR) or missing at random (MAR).

```{r}
pairwise_deletion_data <- pairwise_deletion(data.MAR.uni)
```

## 3. Simple Imputation

Simple imputation replaces missing values using the mean, median, or mode of non-missing data, offering simplicity and ease of use. However, it can introduce bias or unrealistic results, especially in high-dimensional or large-scale data sets, making it unsuitable for handling big data effectively.

#### Mean Imputation

```{r}
# Evaluate imputation method using mean imputation
mean_imputation_data <- simple_imputation(data.MAR.uni, "mean")
mean_metrics <- compare_distributions(train_data, mean_imputation_data)
```

#### Median Imputation

```{r}
# Evaluate imputation method using median imputation
median_imputation_data <- simple_imputation(data.MAR.uni, "median")
median_metrics <- compare_distributions(train_data, median_imputation_data)
```
## 4. Regression Imputation
> NOTE: In the final version this is the idea (fit a model correctly here we simply used stepAIC) for each of the inputation techniqeus were this is needed

Regression imputation replaces missing values using predictions from a regression model built on complete data, preserving sample size and assuming data is missing at random (MAR). It includes single and multivariate regression methods, depending on the number of missing variables. 

```{r, class.source = 'fold-show'}
#' Regression Imputation with Stepwise Selection
#' @param data Data frame with missing values
#' @return Data frame with missing values imputed using stepwise regression
regression_imputation <- function(data) {
  for (col in names(data)) {
    if (any(is.na(data[[col]])) && is.numeric(data[[col]])) {
      # Get complete cases for this column
      complete_data <- data[complete.cases(data), ]
      incomplete_rows <- which(is.na(data[[col]]))
      predictors <- setdiff(names(data), col)
      
      # Fit initial model
      initial_model <- lm(as.formula(paste(col, "~ .")), data = complete_data)
      
      # Perform stepwise selection
      step_model <- stepAIC(initial_model, direction = "both", trace = FALSE)
      
      # Priting the summary of the models obtained
      print(summary(step_model))
      
      # Make predictions using the stepwise model
      predictions <- predict(step_model, newdata = data[incomplete_rows, predictors, drop = FALSE])
      
      # Impute the missing values
      data[[col]][incomplete_rows] <- predictions
    }
  }
  return(data)
}

# Perform imputation on MCAR and MAR datasets
regression_imputation_data <- regression_imputation(data.MAR.uni)
regression_metrics <- compare_distributions(train_data, regression_imputation_data)
```

```{r, echo = F}
# Build and evaluate models
model <- lm(target ~ ., data = regression_imputation_data)
predictions <- predict(model, test_data)
regression_imputation_rmse <- sqrt(mean((test_data$target - predictions)^2))
```

## 5. Hot-deck Imputation

Hot-deck imputation replaces missing values by selecting a donor from similar cases with complete data, either randomly or based on the closest match. It is widely used because it preserves data structure, reduces bias, and avoids model dependency. However, it lacks a robust theoretical foundation compared to other imputation techniques. 

```{r}
# Evaluate imputation method using hot-deck imputation
hotdeck_imputation_data <- hot_deck_imputation(data.MAR.uni)
hotdeck_metrics <- compare_distributions(train_data, hotdeck_imputation_data)
```

## 6. Expectation-Maximization (EM)

The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm iteratively handles missing data using an "impute, estimate, and iterate" process until convergence. It alternates between the expectation step, estimating missing values based on observed data, and the maximization step, optimizing the likelihood of the complete data. It requires costly matrix computations.

```{r}
# Evaluate imputation method using EM imputation
em_imputation_data <- em_imputation(data.MAR.uni)
em_metrics <- compare_distributions(train_data, em_imputation_data)
```

## 7. Multiple Imputation

Multiple imputation addresses missing data by generating multiple complete datasets using observed data distributions to estimate missing values, reflecting uncertainty. Analysis is performed on each dataset, and results are combined into a single estimate. This technique overcomes single imputation limitations, reducing bias and providing more reliable results. 

## 8. GAM Imputation

GAM-based imputation leverages Generalized Additive Models to handle missing data, allowing for flexible modeling of relationships between variables. This technique is particularly effective when the relationship between predictors and the target variable is non-linear.

```{r}
# Evaluate imputation method using GAM-based imputation
gam_imputation_data <- gam_based_imputation(data.MAR.uni)
gam_metrics <- compare_distributions(train_data, gam_imputation_data)
```

## Imputation methods inspired by ML

> Evaluate which of those one makes sense to actually test

### Decision tree / Random Forests

Decision tree imputation builds a predictive model for each variable with missing data by constructing a decision tree where branches represent decisions based on predictor variables, and leaves represent the predicted values. This method can handle both categorical and numerical data while capturing complex interactions and patterns in the data.

```{r}
# Evaluate imputation method using tree-based (Random Forest) imputation
forest_imputation_data <- tree_based_imputation(data.MAR.uni)
forest_metrics <- compare_distributions(train_data, forest_imputation_data)
```

### The Kantorovich Problem

The Kantorovich problem calculates the distance between two probability measures.

**Definition:**
let \((X, \mathcal{X})\) and \((Y, \mathcal{Y})\) be two Polish spaces, that is, complete and separable metric spaces. 
Consider two probability measures \(P\) and \(Q\) belonging to the set of probability measures on \(X\) and \(Y\), 
respectively denoted by \(\mathcal{P}(X)\) and \(\mathcal{P}(Y)\). 

We define the set

$$
\Pi(P,Q) := \bigl\{\pi \in \mathcal{P}(X \times Y) : 
\pi(X \times \cdot) = P(\cdot),\ \pi(\cdot \times Y) = Q(\cdot)\bigr\},
$$

which is the class of probability measures on \((X \times Y,\, \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y})\) 
whose marginals are \(P\) and \(Q\). The elements \(\pi\) of this class are called transport plans.

All elements of \(\Pi\) are probability measures that can be interpreted as ways to transfer the "mass" from \(P\) to \(Q\). 

However, moving this "mass" has a cost, defined by the cost function

$$
c(\cdot,\cdot) : X \times Y \to \mathbb{R}.
$$

Then, once a transport plan \(\pi \in \Pi\) is fixed, we define

$$
I_c(\pi) := \int_{X \times Y} c(x,y)\,\pi(dx\,dy),
$$

which represents the average cost of transferring \(P\) to \(Q\), associated with that particular transport plan. 

We can therefore formulate the Kantorovich problem as follows:

$$
K_c(P,Q) := \inf_{\pi \in \Pi} \int_{X \times Y} c(x,y)\,\pi(dx\,dy).
$$

Having defined the Kantorovich problem, we now assume that \(X = Y\) and let \(d\) be a distance on \(X\).  
We can then define the Wasserstein distance of order \(p\), denoted \(W_p\), as follows:

$$
W_p(P,Q) 
:= K_{d^p}(P,Q)^{1/p} 
= \biggl(\inf_{\pi \in \Pi(P,Q)} \int_{X^2} d^p(x,y)\,\pi(dx\,dy)\biggr)^{\!\!1/p}.
$$

The difference between the Kantorovich definition and the Wasserstein definition lies in the cost function, 
which is given by \(d(x,y)^p\), where \(d(\cdot,\cdot)\) is a distance on \(X\). It is precisely this definition 
of the cost function that guarantees, via the following proposition, that \(W_p\) is indeed a distance.

**Proposition**  
Assume \(X = Y\) and that for \(p > 1\), \(c(x,y) = d(x,y)^p\), where \(d\) is a distance on \(X\), i.e.:

1. \(d(x,y) = d(y,x) \geq 0\);
2. \(d(x,y) = 0\) if and only if \(x = y\);
3. \(\forall (x,y,z) \in X^3,\ d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)\).

Then \(W_p\) is a distance, namely it is symmetric, positive, satisfies \(W_p(P,Q) = 0\) 
if and only if \(P = Q\), and fulfills the triangle inequality:

$$
\forall (P,Q,Z) \in \mathcal{P}(X)^3 \quad 
W_p(P,Z) \le W_p(P,Q) + W_p(Q,Z).
$$

#### The Discrete Case

The Kantorovich problem can also be expressed in discrete form.

**Definition:** suppose \(X = \{ x_1, \dots, x_n \}\) and \(Y = \{ y_1, \dots, y_m \}\). 
In this case, \(P\) and \(Q\) can be identified with two probability vectors 
\(a \in \Sigma_n\) and \(b \in \Sigma_m\), where

$$
\Sigma_n 
= \bigl\{ a \in \mathbb{R}_+^n : \sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 1 \bigr\}.
$$

These probability vectors can be thought of as histograms, in which 
each \(a_i\) represents the probability associated with \(x_i\), and each \(b_j\) 
represents the probability associated with \(y_j\). 

We can define the discrete analogue of the set of probability measures 
\(\Pi(P,Q)\) as follows:

$$
U(a, b) := \bigl\{\, P \in \mathbb{R}_+^{n \times m} : 
P\,\mathbf{1}_m = a,\; P^\top \mathbf{1}_n = b \bigr\},
$$

where \(P\) is the transport matrix, the discrete analogue of 
the transport plan \(\pi\). In other words, 
\(P_{i,j}\) tells us how much mass to move from the point \(x_i\) to the point \(y_j\).

From bin \(i\) of \(a\) to bin \(j\) of \(b\). The constraints related to the set \(U(a,b)\) 
are similar to those of \(\Pi\), meaning that the sum of the rows or columns 
returns \(a\) or \(b\), so that \(P\,\mathbf{1}_m = a = \sum_{j=1}^m P_{i,j}\) 
for each \(i \in \{1,\dots,n\}\) and \(P^\top \mathbf{1}_n = \sum_{i=1}^n P_{i,j} = b_j\) 
for each \(j \in \{1,\dots,m\}\).

The cost function \(\mathbf{c}\) is represented by a matrix \(\mathbf{C} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}\), 
where each \(C_{i,j} = c(x_i, y_j)\) explains the cost of going from \(a_i\) to \(b_j\). 
The average cost analogous to \(I_c\) in the discrete case is defined as

$$
\bar{I}_c 
= \sum_{i,j} C_{i,j} \, P_{i,j}.
$$

We can then formulate the discrete Kantorovich problem as follows:

$$
L_C(a,b) 
:= \min_{P \in U(a,b)} \sum_{i,j} C_{i,j} \, P_{i,j}.
$$

As in the continuous case, assuming \(X, Y \subset E\), with \(E\) a metric space 
equipped with a distance \(d\), we can also define the Wasserstein distance 
of order \(p\) in the discrete setting:

$$
W_p(a,b) 
:= \min_{P \in U(a,b)} 
\biggl(\sum_{i,j} D_{i,j}^p \, P_{i,j}\biggr)^{\!\!1/p}.
$$

where \(D_{i,j}^p = d^p(x_i, y_j)\) is the matrix of distances between the points \(x_i\) and \(y_j\).  
If \(X,Y \subset \mathbb{R}^n\), a standard example of distance between two points in the discrete case 
is \(D_{i,j} = \|x_i - y_j\|\), where \(\|\cdot\|\) is the Euclidean norm.

In the Wasserstein case, we consider the cost matrix \(\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{D}\), 
with \(\mathbf{D}\) being the matrix of Euclidean distances. 

### Jensenâ€“Shannon Divergence

The Jensenâ€“Shannon divergence (JSD) is a measure of similarity (or dissimilarity) between two probability distributions. 
**Definition:** let \(P\) and \(Q\) be two discrete probability distributions over the same domain \(\Omega\). Define

\[
M = \tfrac{1}{2}\,(P + Q),
\]

which is the average (or midpoint) distribution of \(P\) and \(Q\). Then the Jensenâ€“Shannon divergence between \(P\) and \(Q\) is given by

\[
\mathrm{JSD}(P \,\|\, Q) 
= \tfrac{1}{2}\,\mathrm{KL}(P \,\|\, M)
+ \tfrac{1}{2}\,\mathrm{KL}(Q \,\|\, M),
\]

where \(\mathrm{KL}(\cdot \,\|\, \cdot)\) denotes the KL divergence, defined by:

\[
\mathrm{KL}(P \,\|\, Q) 
= \sum_{x \in \Omega} P(x) \,\log\!\Bigl(\tfrac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\Bigr).
\]

**Properties:**

1. **Symmetry**  
   \[
   \mathrm{JSD}(P \,\|\, Q) = \mathrm{JSD}(Q \,\|\, P).
   \]
   This follows because \(M\) is symmetric in \(P\) and \(Q\).

2. **Non-negativity**  
   \[
   \mathrm{JSD}(P \,\|\, Q) \ge 0,
   \]
   with equality if and only if \(P = Q\).

3. **Boundedness**  
   \[
   0 \,\le\, \mathrm{JSD}(P \,\|\, Q) \,\le\, \log(2).
   \]
   The maximum value \(\log(2)\) occurs when \(P\) and \(Q\) have disjoint supports.

4. **Metric Property**  
   Taking the square root gives a metric:
   \[
   d_{\mathrm{JSD}}(P, Q) := \sqrt{\mathrm{JSD}(P \,\|\, Q)}.
   \]
   This metric satisfies the triangle inequality.

## Performance metrics for the Prediction

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

    MAE measures the average difference between imputed values and true values defined as:
    
    $$
    MAE = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m|y_i - \hat{y}_i|
    $$

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
    
    While MSE is equal to the sum of variance and squared predicted missing value as in the following equation:
    
    $$
    MSE = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
    $$

- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**

    RMSE computes the difference in imputed values and actual values as follows:
  
    $$
    RMSE = \sqrt{MSE}
    $$
    
- **Area under the curve (AUC)**

    AUC is the representation of the degree or measure of separability and is used as a summary of the Root Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve, which is curve is a visualisation graph representing imputation performance [143]. The AUC is represented by the true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR). Where the TPR is the proportion of correctly imputed positives of all positives and the TPR is the proportion of all negatives that are wrongly imputed as positives [144]. The true positive rate and the false positive rate are defined as:
    
    $$
    TPR = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} \tag{21}
    $$
    
    $$
    FPR = \frac{FP}{FP + TN} \tag{22}
    $$
