# Statistical Analysis of Missing At Random (MAR) Data

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Missing At Random (MAR) data patterns using simulated datasets. The analysis is conducted through various statistical methods to understand and handle missing data scenarios effectively.

## Description

The project investigates Missing At Random (MAR) patterns in data through simulation studies. We develop and test our methodological approach using simulated datasets before applying it to real-world scenarios. The analysis includes:

- Data simulation procedures
- Implementation of MAR mechanisms
- Statistical analysis of missing patterns
- Evaluation of handling methods
- Performance metrics and results visualization

## Getting Started

The main analysis and experiments are contained in the `experiments.Rmd` file. This R Markdown document includes:

- Data simulation setup
- Implementation of statistical methods
- Results visualization
- Documentation of findings

## Preliminary Results

_Note: Preliminary results should be submitted 10 days before the exam for feedback on next steps._
