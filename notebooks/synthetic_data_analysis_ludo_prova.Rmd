# Data Generation and Exploration

## Synthetic Dataset Creation

We begin by analyzing simpler datasets to explore various imputation methods. Initially, we generate datasets without missing values. 
In the subsequent step, we introduce missing values according to two mechanisms: Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) and Missing at Random (MAR).

Our analysis starts with the creation of a synthetic dataset designed to exhibit specific correlations among covariates. We define a target variable that has a different types of relationships with these covariates.

First Dataset: this simpler dataset assumes a linear relationship among covariates, with the target variable linearly dependent on them.
By structuring our study in this manner, we can systematically assess how different imputation methods perform under varying conditions of data missingness and correlation structures.

```{r, echo=T, class.source = 'fold-show'}
# Generate synthetic dataset with 5 covariates, a linear relationship between the variable and predictor
# And also a linear relationship with the covariates.
synthetic_data_linear <- synthetic_dataset_gen(n_samples = 1000, 
                                        n_covariates = 5, 
                                        correlation = "linear", 
                                        target_type = "linear", 
                                        noise_level = 0.5)

# Summary of the dataset
summary(synthetic_data_linear)
```
The summary is not very informative considering this is just a synthetic dataset.

Second Dataset: we consider a second dataset in which the relations among covariates are more complex (non-linear relationships) and the target depends on covariates in a polynomial manner.

```{r, echo=T, class.source = 'fold-show'}
#Dataset with complex covariate correlations and polynomial target:
set.seed(123)
synthetic_data_complex_poly <- synthetic_dataset_gen(
  n_samples = 1000,
  n_covariates = 5,
  correlation = "complex",
  target_type = "polynomial",
  noise_level = 0.5
)

summary(synthetic_data_complex_poly)
```
Third dataset:we consider a more complex dataset in which the covariates exhibit polynomial relationships and the target is generated using spline functions for smooth, non-linear relationships.

```{r, echo=T, class.source = 'fold-show'}
#Dataset with polynomial covariates and spline target:
set.seed(123)
synthetic_data_poly_spline <- synthetic_dataset_gen(
  n_samples = 200,
  n_covariates = 3,
  correlation = "polynomial",
  target_type = "spline",
  noise_level = 1.0
)
summary(synthetic_data_poly_spline)
```

## Data Visualization

This section should be expanded to explore the final chosen dataset more in depth.

The first step in our analyses is to visualize the correlation between the continuous covariates in our dataset.

First model: since we assume linear relationships among variables we can plot the correlation matrix in order to clearly visualize how and how much the variables are correlated.

```{r, echo = F}
cor_matrix <- cor(synthetic_data_linear)
install.packages("nord")
library(nord)

# Define colors using a Nord palette
blue_nord <- nord("frost", 4)[[length(nord("frost", 4))]]  # Choose a Nord palette and number of colors
red_nord <- nord("aurora", 1)

library(corrplot)
# Plot the correlation matrix
corrplot.mixed(cor_matrix, 
               lower = "number", 
               upper = "ellipse",
               addgrid.col = "gray",
               tl.col = "black",
               tl.cex = 0.7,
               lower.col = colorRampPalette(c(blue_nord, "white", red_nord))(100),
               upper.col = colorRampPalette(c(blue_nord, "white", red_nord))(100))
```



Since for the other two dataset we considered non-linear relationships among variables the correlation matrix should be not informative in these two cases. Indeed traditional correlation coefficients like Pearson's may not adequately capture the strength or nature of these associations.

For this reason we can utilize scatterplots to visually assess relationships between variables. Non-linear patterns may become evident, guiding the selection of appropriate analytical methods.

First, consider a scatterplot for each pair of variables in the datasets.

```{r, echo = F}
# Scatter plot matrix linear covariates
pairs(synthetic_data_linear[, c("X1", "X2", "X3", "X4", "X5")],
      main = "Scatter Plot Matrix")

```

```{r, echo = F}
# Scatter plot matrix non-linear covariates
pairs(synthetic_data_complex_poly[, c("X1", "X2", "X3", "X4")],
      main = "Scatter Plot Matrix")

```


```{r, echo = F}
# Scatter plot matrix polynomials covariates
pairs(synthetic_data_poly_spline[, c("X1", "X2", "X3")],
      main = "Scatter Plot Matrix")

```

We can also plot histograms for each covariate to showcase their distributions.

For the first model:
```{r, echo =F}
# Define Nord color palette
library(nord)
nord_colors <- nord("frost", 4)  # Choose a Nord palette and the number of colors you want

# Plot histogram for each continuous variable
data_continuous <- synthetic_data_linear[, sapply(synthetic_data_linear, is.numeric)]

continuous_melted <- reshape2::melt(data_continuous)

install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(continuous_melted, aes(x = value)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, 
                 fill = nord_colors[1],     # Use a color from the Nord palette
                 color = "black",
                 linewidth = 0.2,                 # Adjust this value for thinner borders
                 alpha = 0.7) +
  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free_x") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Continuous Variables", x = "Value", y = "Frequency")
```

For the second model:
```{r, echo =F}
# Define Nord color palette
library(nord)
nord_colors <- nord("frost", 4)  # Choose a Nord palette and the number of colors you want

# Plot histogram for each continuous variable
data_continuous <- synthetic_data_complex_poly[, sapply(synthetic_data_complex_poly, is.numeric)]

continuous_melted <- reshape2::melt(data_continuous)

install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(continuous_melted, aes(x = value)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, 
                 fill = nord_colors[1],     # Use a color from the Nord palette
                 color = "black",
                 linewidth = 0.2,                 # Adjust this value for thinner borders
                 alpha = 0.7) +
  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free_x") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Continuous Variables", x = "Value", y = "Frequency")
```

For the third model:
```{r, echo =F}
# Define Nord color palette
library(nord)
nord_colors <- nord("frost", 4)  # Choose a Nord palette and the number of colors you want

# Plot histogram for each continuous variable
data_continuous <- synthetic_data_poly_spline[, sapply(synthetic_data_poly_spline, is.numeric)]

continuous_melted <- reshape2::melt(data_continuous)

install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(continuous_melted, aes(x = value)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, 
                 fill = nord_colors[1],     # Use a color from the Nord palette
                 color = "black",
                 linewidth = 0.2,                 # Adjust this value for thinner borders
                 alpha = 0.7) +
  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free_x") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Continuous Variables", x = "Value", y = "Frequency")
```



```{rm, echo = F}
# Plot pairwise relationships between continuous variables
# ggpairs(synthetic_data)
```

### Regression Model on Original Dataset (Baseline)

In the third step of our analysis on the complete dataset we want to fit regression models that we will later use for baseline comparison.


*We should instead use a subset of the covariate (that is relevant) for this linear model.*
Let's consider the first model, on which we expect a linear relation and let's fit a linear model.
```{r}

# Calculate number of samples for training set
num_samples <- nrow(synthetic_data_linear) * 0.8

# Randomly sample indices for training set
train_index <- sample(seq_len(nrow(synthetic_data_linear)), size = num_samples)

# Split the dataset in training and testing
train_data <- synthetic_data_linear[train_index, ]
test_data <- synthetic_data_linear[-train_index, ]

# Fit baseline model with all of the covariates
baseline_model <- lm(target ~ ., data = train_data)
baseline_predictions <- predict(baseline_model, test_data)
baseline_rmse <- sqrt(mean((baseline_predictions - test_data$target)^2))

summary(baseline_model)
paste("RMSE on the test set: ", baseline_rmse)
```
We can fit also different models, that we expect to perform not better than the linear model when the relations are linear, but better in other cases. 

```{r}

library(caret)  # For model training and evaluation
library(rpart)  # For decision trees
library(mgcv)   # For Generalized Additive Models (GAM)

#For Polynomial target and complex covariates
# Linear Model
lm_model <- lm(target ~ ., data = synthetic_data_complex_poly)

# Generalized Additive Model
gam_model <- gam(target ~ s(X1) + s(X2) + s(X3) + s(X4), data = synthetic_data_complex_poly)

# Decision Tree
rpart_model <- rpart(target ~ ., data = synthetic_data_complex_poly)

#For spline target and polynomials covariates
# Linear Model
lm_model <- lm(target ~ ., data = synthetic_data_poly_spline)

# Generalized Additive Model
gam_model <- gam(target ~ s(X1) + s(X2) + s(X3), data = synthetic_data_poly_spline)

# Decision Tree
rpart_model <- rpart(target ~ ., data = synthetic_data_poly_spline)

```


# Missing Data Analysis

In statistical analysis, understanding the patterns of missing data is crucial for selecting appropriate handling methods. The primary patterns are:

**Univariate Missing Data**: Occurs when only a single variable has missing values. This pattern is uncommon across most disciplines and typically arises in experimental studies. 

**Monotone Missing Data**: Characterized by a situation where the missingness of one variable implies the missingness of all subsequent variables. This pattern is often observed in longitudinal studies where participants drop out and do not return. The monotone pattern is generally easier to manage, as the missingness follows a clear, observable sequence. 

**Non-Monotone Missing Data**: Occurs when the missingness of one variable does not predict the missingness of other variables. This pattern is more complex and requires careful analysis to handle appropriately. 

Recognizing these patterns helps in choosing suitable methods for handling missing data, thereby improving the robustness and validity of statistical analyses.

We now focus on generating missing data in the synthetic datasets.
The **mechanisms for generating missing data** can be classified into three different types based on how the data is missing in relation to the observed and unobserved values. 

Here is a summary focusing on **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)** and **Conditionally at Random (CAR, often referred to as MAR â Missing At Random)** mechanisms:

## Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)

**Definition**: In the MCAR mechanism, the missingness is entirely independent of both observed and unobserved data. The probability that data is missing does not depend on any feature values.
$$P(M | X, \xi) = P(M | \xi)$$

**Implementation**: Missing values are inserted randomly across the dataset, either using Bernoulli trials or random selection methods. Common configurations include univariate (one feature) or multivariate (multiple features) generation, with random positions selected for deletion.

MCAR mechanisms are straightforward since missingness is independent of any feature values. Various methods can be used to generate MCAR data:

**Univariate MCAR Implementation**: Only one feature in the dataset has missing values. *Methods*:

  - **Random Position Selection**: Select a feature $x_{miss}$ and delete values at random positions using a random number generator or permutation.  
  - **Bernoulli Trials**: Use Bernoulli trials to determine missingness. A success probability $p$ corresponds to the desired missing rate (MR). Each data point has a probability $p$ of being set as missing.  
    Example: For a missing rate of 10% in a feature with 100 observations, 10 random positions are marked as missing.
    
**Challenges**:  

  - For small datasets, Bernoulli trials may lead to variation in the actual missing rate due to random variation from small sample sizes.

**Multivariate MCAR Implementation**: Missing values are distributed across multiple features. *Methods*:

  - **Uniform Distribution**: Generate missing values equally across all features. Each feature has the same missing rate.  
  - **Random Distribution**: Choose a total number of missing values based on the desired MR and randomly select cells across the dataset.  
    Example: For a dataset with 1,000 values and a 20% missing rate, 200 cells are randomly selected for deletion across all features.  

**Strengths**: Simple and easy to implement; assumptions are often met in real-world data due to purely random events.  
**Limitations**: The randomness does not reflect dependencies often present in real-world missingness patterns.

## Missing At Random (MAR or CAR)

**Definition**: In the CAR (MAR) mechanism, the probability of missing data depends on the values of observed data but not on the unobserved (missing) values themselves. It assumes a dependency between missingness and observed features.

$$P(M | X, \xi) = P(M | X_{obs}, \xi)$$

**Example**: Younger participants in a smoking survey might be more likely to skip reporting their cigarette consumption, but the missingness is independent of the actual number of cigarettes consumed.

**Implementation**: Several approaches exist, often involving a determining feature. For instance, missing values in one feature (like cigarette consumption) may depend on values of another observed feature (like age). Configurations can involve ranks, percentiles, or division into groups based on a featureâs value.

Each mechanism carries implications for analysis and imputation, as assumptions about the data's structure influence how accurately the missing values can be predicted or imputed.

In MAR mechanisms, missingness depends on observed values of other features but not on the missing values themselves. This adds complexity to the generation process:

**Univariate MAR Implementation**: Missing values in one feature $x_{miss}$ are determined by the values of another feature $x_{obs}$ (also called the determining feature). *Methods*:

  - **Rank-Based Selection**: Compute the ranks of $x_{obs}$ and assign higher or lower probabilities for missingness based on these ranks.  
    Example: Select a feature $x_{age}$. Younger participants (lower ranks) may have a higher probability of missingness in a related feature $x_{smoking\_habits}$.  
    - Probability of missingness for each pattern:  
      $P(x_{i,miss} = \text{missing}) = \frac{r_{i,obs}}{\sum r_{i,obs}}$  
      where $r_{i,obs}$ is the rank of the $i^{th}$ observation of $x_{obs}$.  
  - **Percentile or Cut-off Method**: Sort the values of $x_{obs}$ and choose missing positions in $x_{miss}$ corresponding to lower values in $x_{obs}$. The cutoff may be determined by a percentile.  
    Example: Missing values in $x_{income}$ might be set for individuals below the 25th percentile of $x_{education\_level}$.  

**Multivariate MAR Implementation**: MAR for multiple features requires defining relationships among multiple pairs of features. *Methods*:
  
  - **Pairs of Features**:  
    Select pairs $\{x_{obs}, x_{miss}\}$ for each combination of features. Missing values in $x_{miss}$ are inserted based on observed values in $x_{obs}$.  
    Example: Create missing values in $x_{cholesterol}$ based on high or low values of $x_{age}$. Adjust missing rates for individual features to maintain the overall datasetâs MR.  

  - **Correlated Feature Sets**:  
    When the dataset contains correlated features, missingness can be simulated in dependent features. MAR implementations often simulate this by ordering features by correlation or mutual information with the class label and generating missing values progressively.

**Challenges**:  

- MAR implementations can be sensitive to the choice of the determining feature. Consistent experimental design is crucial when evaluating imputation methods using synthetic MAR data.  
- Generating accurate MAR patterns requires careful tuning of dependency relationships, especially when working with nominal or categorical features, as ranking or ordering becomes problematic.

In R, the missMethods library allows efficient generation of missing values under different mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR), aiding in testing imputation methods and evaluating missing data impacts.


## Introducing Missing Data

### Missing data in the original dataset
> Obviously, no missing data is present in our dataset; it is synthetically generated.

```{r}
# Plot missing data patterns in the original dataset
original_missing <- as.data.frame(sapply(synthetic_data, is.na))
original_missing$index <- 1:nrow(original_missing)
original_missing_melted <- melt(original_missing, id.vars = "index")

ggplot(original_missing_melted, aes(x = index, y = variable, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("white", red_nord)) +
  labs(title = "Missing Data Pattern - Original", x = "Index", y = "Variable")
```

# Ensuring methods work as expected
sum(is.na(data_mcar)) # Should be approximately 10%
sum(is.na(data_mar)) # Should be approximately 10%
```

```{r, echo =F}
# Analyze missing patterns and summarize
# print(summarize_missing(data_mcar))

```
# Count missing values in each column
sapply(data_mcar, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
# Calculate the percentage of missing values in each column
sapply(data_mcar, function(x) mean(is.na(x)) * 100)
